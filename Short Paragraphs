We wanted to investigate data on NBA players from 2020-21 compared to 2023-2024. We took two data sets, 
one from each year, and combined them to analyze players such as Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Maxey, 
Patrick Williams and others. We had to pull similar data from the appropriate columns to compare them. 
We also made sure that we filtered out a 2020 draft class so that we had only the players we were interested 
in which is from the draft. Our visualizations did most of the story telling, and we had graphs that 
showed the improvement or worsening in minutes played per game for certain players, their eFG percentage, 
and player points. 



The first graph illustrates the changes in minutes played per game for NBA players between the 2020 and 2023 seasons.
It highlights variations in players' involvement, with some, like Anthony Edwards, seeing significant increases in playing 
time, while others, such as R.J. Hampton, experienced decreases. This metric reflects players' evolving roles and importance within their teams.


The second graph compares the points per game scored by NBA players in 2020 and 2023.
Notable improvements are observed in players like Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton,
demonstrating their growth as scorers. Conversely, some players show stagnation or declines, reflecting changes in their scoring contributions.


The third graph evaluates players' effective field goal percentage, which measures scoring efficiency 
by accounting for three-point shots. While many players maintain or improve their efficiency, R.J. 
Hampton shows a notable decline. This graph provides insights into players' shooting effectiveness and adjustments over time.
